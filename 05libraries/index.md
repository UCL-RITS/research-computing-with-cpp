## Why use Libraries?

### Scientific Coding

* Explain your science
    * Should not just distribute binaries and papers
    * Source code is best description of your science
* Reproducible science     
    * Collaborators must know how you build your project and libraries
* Time is short
    * Don't re-invent the wheel
    * Use libraries if they provide bits you need


### What are libraries?

* Libraries provide collections of useful classes and functions, ready to use
* C++ libraries can be somewhat harder to use than pure Python modules
* This lecture will get you started


### Aim for this chapter

* How to choose a library
    * Licensing, longevity, developer community, technical implementation, **feature list** etc.
* Working with libraries
    * Including them
    * C++ concepts
    * Not an exhaustive product specific tutorial
