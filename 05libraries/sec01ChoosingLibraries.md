title: Choosing Libraries

## Choosing libraries

### Libraries are Awesome

A [great set of libraries allows for a very powerful programming style][Python04Intro]:

* Write minimal code yourself
    * Choose the right libraries
    * Plug them together
    * Create impressive results


### Libraries for Efficiency

Not only is this efficient with your programming time,
it's also more efficient with computer time.

The chances are any general algorithm you might want to use
has already been programmed better by someone else.


### Software Licenses

* Consider both:
    * License for 3rd party code / dependencies
    * License for your code when you distribute it

* So, even if you aren't distributing code yet, you need to understand the licenses of your dependencies.


### Third Party Licenses

CAVEAT: This is not legal advice. If in doubt, seek your own legal advice.

* When you distribute your code, the licenses of any libraries you use takes effect
* If library has:
    * [MIT][MITLicense] and [BSD][BSDLicense] are permissive. So you can do what you want, including sell it on.
    * [Apache][ApacheLicense] handles multiple contributors and patent rights, but is basically permissive.


### Third Party Licenses

CAVEAT: This is not legal advice. If in doubt, seek your own legal advice.

* When you distribute your code, the licenses of any libraries you use takes effect
* If library has:
    * [GPL][GPLLicense] requires you to open-source your code, including changes to the library you imported, and your work is considered a "derivative work", so must be shared.
    * [LGPL][LGPLLicense] for libraries, but use dynamic not static linkage. If you use static linking its basically as per [GPL][GPLLicense].

* Still some debate on [GPL/LGPL and derivative works](https://lwn.net/Articles/548216/) - only true test is in court.


### Choosing a License

CAVEAT: This is not legal advice. If in doubt, seek your own legal advice.

* When you plan to distribute code:    
    * Read [this book][LicensingBook], and/or [GitHub's advice][Chooselicense], and [OSI][OSI] for choosing your own license.
    * Don't write your own license, unless you use legal advice.
    * Try to pick one of the standard ones for compatibility.

* Note: Once a 3rd party has your code under a license agreement, their restrictions are determined by that version of the code.

     
### Choose Stability

* So, take care in your choice of 3rd party library
    * Don't want to redo work later.
    * Don't want to rely too heavily on non-distributable code.
    * But if you do, understand what that means.


### Is Library Updated?

* Code that is not developed, rots.
    * When was the last commit?
    * How often are there commits?
    * Is the code on an open version control tool like GitHub?


### Are Developers Reachable?

* Can you find the lead contributor on the internet?
    * Do they respond when approached?
* Are there contributors other than the lead contributor?


### Is Code Tested?

* Are there many unit tests, do they run, do they pass?
* Does the library depend on other libraries?
* Are the build tools common?
* Is there a sensible versioning scheme (e.g. [semantic versioning][semver]).
* Is there a suitable release schedule?


### Is Library High Quality?

* Shouldn't need to look excessively closely, but consider
    * Documentation
    * Number of ToDo's
    * Dependencies (recursively)
    * Data Structures? How to import/export image
    * Can you write a convenient wrapper?
    
    
### Library Features

* Then look at features
    * Manual
    * Easy to use


### Summary

* In comparison with languages such as MATLAB/Python
    * In C++ prefer few well chosen libraries
    * Be aware of their licenses for future distribution
    * Keep a log of any changes, patches etc. that you make
    * Be able to compile all your own code, including libraries
        * so need common build environment. (eg. CMake, Make, Visual Studio).
