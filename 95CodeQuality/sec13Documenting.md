## To comment or not to comment

Comments are easier to write poorly than well, and commenting can be more damaging than helpful 

The heated discussions over the virtues of commenting often sound like philosophical debates over moral virtues

## Keys to effective comments - 1

Comments can be classified into six categories:

**Repeat of the Code**

- It merely gives the reader of the code more to read without providing additional information

**Explanation of the Code**

- It’s nearly always better to improve the code than it is to add comments

**Marker in the Code**

- A marker comment is one that isn’t intended to be left in the code

## Keys to effective comments - 2

**Summary of the Code**

- Summary comments are particularly useful when someone other than the code’s original author tries to modify the code

**Description of the Code’s Intent**

**Information That Cannot Possibly Be Expressed by the Code Itself**

- Some information can’t be expressed in code but must still be in the source code

## Commenting efficiently

Effective commenting isn’t that time-consuming

Too many comments are as bad as too few, and you can achieve a middle ground economically

Comments can take a lot of time to write for two common reasons: 

- First, the commenting style might be time-consuming or tedious. If it is, find a new style

- Second, commenting might be difficult because the words to describe what the program is doing don’t come easily

## Guidelines

**Use styles that don’t break down or discourage modification**

- Any style that’s too fancy is annoying to maintain.

**Integrate commenting into your development style**

**Performance is not a good reason to avoid commenting**

**Don't write comments at the same level of abstraction than the code**

## Commenting techniques

Commenting Individual Lines

- Avoid self-indulgent comments

- Avoid endline comments for multiple lines of code

- Use endline comments to annotate data declarations

- Use endline comments to mark ends of blocks

## Commenting techniques

Commenting Paragraphs of Code

- Write comments at the level of the code’s intent

- Focus your documentation efforts on the code itself

- Focus paragraph comments on the why rather than the how

- Use comments to prepare the reader for what is to follow

- Avoid abbreviations

- Differentiate between major and minor comments
