## C++ Standard Library 

### What is it 

* A collection of:
   * Containers (e.g. `std::vector`, `std::array`, `std::map`, ...)
   * Methods to manipulate these containers (e.g. `std::sort`, `std::find_if`)
   * Strings (`std::string`) and streams (e.g. `std::cout`, `std::endl`, ...) 
   * Function objects (e.g. arithmetic operations, comparisons and logical operations, ...)

* Part of the ISO Standard itself so it has to be implemented to be called C++
   * Can include in your code by simply adding the relevant `#include <headername>` and then using the `std::` namespace 
   * A list of these headers can be found at [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header)

### Homework - 13

* Write short code snippets that use:
   * Containers `<array>`, `<vector>` and `<map>`  
   * The `<random>` number generator library
   * The `<iostream>` to read in a string from the terminal and output it to screen
