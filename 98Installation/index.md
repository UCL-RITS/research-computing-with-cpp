## Development Environment
 
To go through the course material, work in class and complete your assignments you will need:
* Git version control system 
* A C++ compiler (gcc/g++ >= 9.3.0) with C++17 enabled
* CMake build software (>= 3.10)
* An integrated development environment (IDE). We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), but you can use whichever you prefer although support could be limited

We encourage everyone to use Ubuntu 20.04 and the same development environment (same C++ version, cmake version, same VS Code IDE) as this will be most efficient in terms of providing support with installation, debugging problems and sharing code. This isn't a requirement and you can use another setup that you prefer as long as it meets the above requirements, but again support could be limited.

## Getting your computer ready

Details on how to _Get your computer ready_ are given on the PHAS0100 moodle page under the _Before you begin_ topic.
