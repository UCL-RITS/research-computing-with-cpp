### Why use Libraries?

\begin{center}
\textbf{Scientific Coding}
\end{center}

Explain your science

* Should **not** just distribute binaries and papers
* Source code is the **most accurate** description of your science

Reproducible science     

* Collaborators **must know how** you build your project and libraries

Time is short

* Don't re-invent the wheel
* Use libraries if they provide bits you need
* Gain in productivity


### What are libraries?

* Libraries provide collections of useful classes and functions
* Ready to use
* ```C++``` libraries can be somewhat harder to use
  * _e.g._ than pure ```Python``` modules
* This lecture will get you started


### Aim for this chapter

How to choose a library ?

* Licensing
* Longevity / maintenance
* Active developer community
* Easiness of technical implementation
* **Feature list**

Working with libraries

* Including them
* ```C++``` concepts
* Not an exhaustive product specific tutorial
