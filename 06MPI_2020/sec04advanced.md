## More advanced MPI

### Architecture and usage

* Depending on library, MPI processes can be **placed** on a specific node...
* ... and even chained to specific cores
* Fewer processes than cores means we can do MPI + openMP:
   - some data is distributed (MPI)
   - some data is shared (openMP)
* MPI-3 allows for creating/destroying processes dynamically


### Splitting communicators

``MPI_Group_*`` specify operations to create sets of processes.
In practice, they define operations on sets:

- union
- intersection
- difference

And allow the creation of a communicator for the resulting group.

`MPI_Comm_group` does the converse, giving you a group from a communicator.


### More MPI data-types

It is possible to declare complex data types

- strided vectors, e.g. only one of every element (`MPI_Type_vector`)
- sub-matrices (strided in n axes, n >= 2) (`MPI_Type_Create_struct`)
- irregular strides (`MPI_Type_indexed`)


### One sided communication

Prior to MPI-3, both sending and receiving processes must be aware of the
communication.

One-sided communication allow processes to define a buffer that other processes
can access without their explicit knowledge.


### And also

- Cartesian grid topology where process (1, 1) is neighbour
  of (0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (1, 2). With simplified operations to send data
  EAST, WEST, UP, DOWN....
- More complex graph topologies
- Non-blocking collective operations
