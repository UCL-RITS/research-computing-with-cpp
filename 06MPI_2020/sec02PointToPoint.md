## Point to point communication

### Many point-2-point communication schemes

Can you think of two behaviours for message passing?

![]({% figurepath %}mpi.png)

---

- Process 0 can (i) give message and then either (ii) leave or (iii) wait for
  acknowledgements
- Process 1 can (i) receive message
- MPI can (i) receive message, (ii) deliver message, (iii) deliver
  acknowledgments

### Blocking synchronous send

### Blocking synchronous send


``` cpp
int MPI_Ssend(const void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int dest, int tag,
              MPI_Comm comm)
```

| Parameter | Meaning                                                                                                |
|:----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| buf       | Pointer to buffer. Always `void` because practical C is not type safe.                                 |
| count     | Size of the buffer. I.e. length of the message to send, in units of the specified datatype (not bytes) |
| datatype  | Encodes type of the buffer. ``MPI_INT`` for integers,   ``MPI_CHAR`` for characters.  Lots of others.  |
| dest      | Rank of the **receiving** process                                                                      |
| tag       | A tag for message book-keeping                                                                         |
| comm      | The communicator -- usually just ``MPI_COMM_WORLD``                                                    |
| return    | An error tag. Equals ``MPI_SUCCESS`` on success.                                                       |



### Blocking receive

``` cpp
int MPI_Recv(void *buf, int bufsize, MPI_Datatype datatype, int source, int tag,
             MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status)
```

Good for both synchronous and asynchonous communication

| Parameter | Meaning                                                                                  |
|:----------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| buf       | Pointer to receiving **pre-allocated** buffer                                            |
| bufsize   | Size of the buffer. I.e. maximum length of the message to receive. See ``MPI_Get_count`` |
| datatype  | Informs on the type of the buffer                                                        |
| source    | Rank of the **sending** process                                                          |
| tag       | A tag for message book-keeping                                                           |
| status    | `MPI_STATUS_IGNORE` for now. See ``MPI_Get_count``.                                      |
| comm      | The communicator                                                                         |
| return    | Error tag                                                                                |

### Example: Blocking synchronous example

Inside a new section in the test framework:

{% fragment ssend, cpp/point2point.cc %}

Common bug: Set both sender and receiver to 0. What happens?

### Example: Do you know your C vs C++ strings?

Why the ``+1``?

``` cpp
int const error = MPI_Ssend(
  (void*) peace.c_str(), peace.size() + 1, MPI_CHAR, 1, 42, MPI_COMM_WORLD);
```

. . .

Because C and C++ ``char const*`` strings are null-terminated to indicate the
string is finished, which adds an extra character. However, ``std::string``
abstracts it away. And so its length does **not** include the null-termination.

### Example: Causing a dead-lock

Watch out for order of send and receive!

Bad:

``` cpp
if (rank == 0) {
   MPI_Ssend (sendbuf, count, MPI_INT, 1, tag, comm);
   MPI_Recv (recvbuf, count, MPI_INT, 1, tag, comm, &status);
} else {
   MPI_Ssend (sendbuf, count, MPI_INT, 0, tag, comm);
   MPI_Recv (recvbuf, count, MPI_INT, 0, tag, comm, &status);
}
```

. . .

Good:

```
if (rank == 0) {
   MPI_Ssend (sendbuf, count, MPI_INT, 1, tag, comm);
   MPI_Recv (recvbuf, count, MPI_INT, 1, tag, comm, &status);
} else {
   MPI_Recv (recvbuf, count, MPI_INT, 0, tag, comm, &status);
   MPI_Ssend (sendbuf, count, MPI_INT, 0, tag, comm);
}
```

### Blocking send: MPI_Send

| Stage                         | Figure                          |
|:------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
| a. 0, 1, and MPI stand ready: | ![]({% figurepath %}sync0.png)  |
| b. message dropped off by 0:  | ![]({% figurepath %}sync1.png)  |
| c. transit, 0 leaves          | ![]({% figurepath %}ssyncT.png) |
| d. message received by 1      | ![]({% figurepath %}ssyncA.png) |

### Send vs SSend

Why would we use Send instead of SSend?

{% fragment send, cpp/point2point.cc %}

---

Both guarantee the buffer is safe to reuse. Send makes no guarantee as to
whether it returns early or not. But **SSend** forces a **synchronisation point**:
the codes reach the matching places, with all processes waiting until all reach
that point.

It may come out slightly faster to use Send,
since having a synchronisation point when you don't need one can slow things
down.

---

Suppose (A) runs slightly faster than (B) does; at the end, they've both
been running fully efficiently.

![]({% figurepath %}efficient.png)

---

Wth a synchronisation point in between, you'll have wasted time:

![]({% figurepath %}inefficient.png)

---

This is only important when there is noise
or variability in the execution time on different processes,
but this is often the case.

So unnecessary synchronisation points are bad. The MPI Implementation
may choose to buffer, or synchronise in Send; you're letting MPI guess.

However, if you want to fine tune this to get the best performance,
you should use Isend.

### Non-blocking MPI_Isend
| Stage                          | Figure                          |
|:-------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
| a. 0, 1, and MPI stand ready:  | ![]({% figurepath %}async0.png) |
| b. 0 leaves message in safebox | ![]({% figurepath %}async1.png) |
| c. transit                     | ![]({% figurepath %}asyncT.png) |
| d. message received by 1       | ![]({% figurepath %}asyncA.png) |
| e. receipt placed in safebox   | ![]({% figurepath %}asyncR.png) |

### Non-blocking: Isend/Irecv

With Isend, we indicate when we want the message to set off.

We receive a handle to the message, of type `MPI_Request*`
which we can use to require it has
been received, or check.

This produces more complicated code, but you can write code which **overlaps
calculation with communication**: the message is travelling, while you
get on with something else. We'll see a practical
example of using this next lecture.

---

{% fragment isend, cpp/point2point.cc %}

### Function signatures

``` cpp
int MPI_Isend(const void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int dest, int tag,
              MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Request *request)


int MPI_Irecv(void *buf, int bufsize, MPI_Datatype datatype, int source, int tag,
              MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Request *request)
```

. . .

``` cpp
int MPI_Recv(void *buf, int bufsize, MPI_Datatype datatype, int source, int tag,
             MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status)
```

### Pass the parcel: SendRecv

Consider a group of N processes in a ring: each has a value, and wants to "pass
the parcel" to the left. How would you achieve this with SSend and Receive?

{% fragment setup, cpp/ring.cc %}

---

With synchronous calls each process can only either be sending or receiving.
So the even processes need to send, while the odd ones receive, then vice-versa.
This is clearly inefficient.

{% fragment ssend, cpp/ring.cc %}

---

With ISend/IRecv, this can be achieved in one go: each process posts its
send, then posts its receive, then waits for completion.

{% fragment isend, cpp/ring.cc %}

---

However, this is such a common pattern, that there is a separate MPI call to
make this easier:


``` cpp
int MPI_Sendrecv(void *sendbuf, int scount, MPI_Datatype stype, int dest, int stag,
                 void *recvbuf, int rcount, MPI_Datatype rtype, int source, int rtag,
                 MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status)
```

Each argument is duplicated for the send and receive payloads.

### Classroom exercise

Implement ring-send using Sendrecv.

### Point to point summary

Sending messages:

| name      | Blocking | forces synchronisation point | Buffer-safe |
|:----------|:---------|:-----------------------------|:------------|
| MPI_Ssend | yes      | yes                          | yes         |
| MPI_Send  | maybe    | no                           | yes         |
| MPI_Isend | no       | no                           | no          |

Receiving messages:

| name      | blocking |
|:----------|:---------|
| MPI_Recv  | yes      |
| MPI_Irecv | no       |

(There are a few others, rarely used - see [MPI manuals](https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/v3.0/)!)
