* Also look up [Service Locator Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern)

### Managing Complexity

* Rather than monolithic code (bad)
* We end up with many smaller classes (good)
* So, its more flexible (good)
* It does look more complex at first (don't panic)
* You get used to thinking in small objects
